Hi, I'm Anees Ur Rehman, a passionate and results-driven Data Analyst dedicated to transforming complex data into clear, actionable insights. My expertise spans a robust toolkit, including Excel for advanced data manipulation and reporting, MySQL for efficient database querying and management, and R for statistical analysis and robust data modeling.

I leverage Tableau to create dynamic and interactive dashboards, turning raw data into compelling visual stories that drive informed decision-making. My core strengths lie in data cleaning, ensuring data accuracy and consistency, and data visualization, presenting intricate datasets in an easily digestible and impactful manner. Furthermore, I'm exploring and integrating AI-driven techniques to enhance efficiency in MySQL queries, automate data cleaning processes in Excel, and uncover deeper insights in Tableau  visualizations, pushing towards more advanced and predictive analysis.

I am always eager to learn, collaborate, and explore impactful innovations in data analysis and data science. Let's connect and explore how we can grow together.
